This is my reimplementation of the Swissonic A306; an active studio monitor based upon the ADAU1701.  The necessary data was obtained from reverse engineered EEPROM dumps and used to create an easily modifiable Sigma Studio project.

The driver filters have been updated using CEA2034 measurements acquired by Erin's Audio Corner and should produce an on-axis response that is flat to Â±1dB from 49Hz to 20KHz.  The F3 is 45Hz.
